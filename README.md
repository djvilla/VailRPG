# VailRPG :game_die:

This was a Turnbased RPG framework that I attempted to create in GameMaker Studio 2. So far I had transtitions between rooms and a save point.
Other then that there wasn't too much else built into this. This project was mostly just a practice to see how GameMaker Studio worked.

## How to run
You need Game Maker Studio 2 to compile and run this project.

## Version
Built in GameMaker Studio 2 Version 2.2.3.436

## Credits
Inspired by tutorials the ARPG tutorial from [HeartBeast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrHQNOyU1q6BFEfkNq2CYMA).
